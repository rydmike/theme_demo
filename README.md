# Flutter Theming using FlexColorScheme and Riverpod

This Flutter application shows how to use [**FlexColorScheme**](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme) together with [**Riverpod**](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_riverpod) to dynamically change your application theme. It uses Riverpod providers to watch light `theme` and `darkTheme` changes in a [`MaterialApp`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp-class.html), and to change the used [`themeMode`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp/themeMode.html). The theme settings are persisted locally as they are modified. The used local settings persistence implementation can be changed dynamically with the application's user interface.

This app is used to demonstrate FlexColorScheme and Riverpod concepts, and to provide usage suggestions. It is not intended to look pretty or be very useful as an app. 

> This is a **0.9 version** release of this demo app. The principles will remain the same in version 1.0. I might tune it, and this article like readme as I review it, and based on feedback, before I call it version 1.0. I did however want to release it already in its 0.9.x state, as the previous version was out of date. I also always had the intent to include a persisted **FlexColorScheme** theming example, in addition to the ones included with the package, that uses **Riverpod** and an abstracted key-value local DB, with some example implementations. This example serves that purpose and is also linked to from the **FlexColorScheme** documentation.

**TODO:** Consider adding a screen recording GIF.

**TODO:** Consider making a WEB demo build of the app.

## FlexColorScheme 6 and Riverpod 2

This example is designed to work with and use the stable releases of **FlexColorScheme 6** and **Riverpod 2**. It uses many advanced **FlexColorScheme** theming features, but not as many as the [Themes Playground application](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/themesplayground-v6/#/). It does however use more advanced state management techniques than the Themes Playground app, and it has a simple feature-first folder structure, making it easy to find related code by feature. 

This demo is provided as an additional example to the six examples already included with the FlexColorScheme package. It is also mentioned in the [FlexColorScheme docs](https://docs.flexcolorscheme.com/examples#other-examples).

## 2. Features

The demo UI uses several [ToggleButtons](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ToggleButtons-class.html) based Widgets as well as [SwitchListTile.adaptive](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/SwitchListTile/SwitchListTile.adaptive.html), [Slider.adaptive](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Slider/Slider.adaptive.html) and [PopupMenuButton](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/PopupMenuButton-class.html), to compose UI widgets used to toggle several input values for the used and demonstrated FlexColorScheme theming features. 

The app demonstrates how the `ThemeData`, and `ThemeMode` state of the application can be easily managed using **Riverpod**, together with `Providers` and `StateNotifierProviders`. Used to define the current `ThemeData` for light, dark theme and theme mode states. 

It also shows how simple it is to make small UI theme control widgets that can be dropped in anywhere, were needed in an app, and then used to manipulate and modify the `ThemeData` of the application. The UI view widgets modify Riverpod `StateNotifierProviders`, that act as theme property controllers in `ThemeData` providers. The `MaterialApp` widget watches these providers and rebuilds whenever a single theming UI widget is changed anywhere in the application.

## Used `MaterialApp` 

The `MaterialApp` setup is simple and compact. We give the light and dark `ThemeData` objects to their respective theme properties in the `MaterialApp`. Here they are given by providers that we watch for changes. When you use this setup, which one of the currently supplied light and dark `ThemeData` objects gets used as active application theme, is controlled by the `ThemeMode` enum given to the `themeMode` property. We use and watch a third provider for this, so theme mode can easily be toggled via UI. 

If you specify `ThemeMode.system` the application will follow the theme mode used by the host system. Many users like this option, so don't just offer light and dark as option, also offer system as a user choice. A very handy widget to use to allow the user to toggle `ThemeMode` between, light, dark and system is `ToggleButtons`. We will look at that later.  

```dart
class ThemeDemoApp extends ConsumerWidget {
  const ThemeDemoApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    return MaterialApp(
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      scrollBehavior: const AppScrollBehavior(),
      title: AppConst.appName,
      theme: ref.watch(lightThemeProvider),
      darkTheme: ref.watch(darkThemeProvider),
      themeMode: ref.watch(Settings.themeModeProvider),
      initialRoute: HomePage.route,
      routes: <String, WidgetBuilder>{
        SplashPage.route: (BuildContext context) => const SplashPage(),
        ThemeShowcasePage.route: (BuildContext context) => const ThemeShowcasePage(),
        HomePage.route: (BuildContext context) => const HomePage(),
      },
    );
  }
}
```

This approach works regardless of were in the widget tree the actual theme UI controlling widgets are. In this example this is demonstrated by placing all made theme widget controls on the classical default Flutter counter page, yes there is still a counter on the Home page. Some theme settings Widgets are also used in the application drawer, and even more can be found in a bottom sheet.

### Dynamic Key-Value Database Switching

Another feature is that this demo persists all theme settings. The implementation used to persist the settings **can be switched dynamically** in the running app between:

1. Memory, volatile, session based, settings not persisted
2. [Shared preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences)
3. [Hive](https://pub.dev/packages/hive)

This example shows how Riverpod can be used to change the used key-value database dependency from inside the Flutter app UI. This may be interesting to study, since this app needs this dependency to be able to read its settings and start. Yet we can control this from inside the running Flutter app. In this case we are using Riverpod as a service locator and dependency injection replacement.

Is it really necessary to switch a key-value DB persistence implementation at runtime? Well maybe not, but the principle might be useful as an in-app development toggle during development and testing for other data sources, like a remote and mock off-line data source. It can be useful to have a setup that allows you to do it in-app from developer options. Plus I wanted to see if it can be done with just Riverpod, before I would have done this part with [GetIt](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it). 

To be able to do this with only **Riverpod** we need to define a `ProviderContainer` in just plain Dart before we start the Flutter app. We can then access the provider that gives us the currently used key-value DB implementation. We can then perform whatever async initialization the used key-value DB needs. 

Before we start the Flutter app, we also access a provider that sets upp a listener that will run whenever the key-value DB provider is changed.

Below we also define a `AppProviderObserver` as a `ProviderObserver`, we use it to print debug logs whenever any provider in this app changes.

### Our `main` Function

The setup of above feature are done in the `main` function and looks as follows.

```dart
Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // This container can be used to read providers before Flutter app is
  // initialised with UncontrolledProviderScope
  final ProviderContainer container = ProviderContainer(
    // This observer is used for logging changes in all Riverpod providers.
    observers: <ProviderObserver>[AppProviderObserver()],
  );
  // Get default keyValueDb implementation and initialize it for use.
  await container.read(keyValueDbProvider).init();
  // The app will also listen to state changes in keyValueDbProvider.
  // This allows us to swap the keyValueDb implementation used in the app
  // dynamically between: Hive, SharedPreferences and volatile memory.
  container.read(keyValueDbListenerProvider);
  runApp(
    UncontrolledProviderScope(
      container: container,
      child: const ThemeDemoApp(),
    ),
  );
}
```

### Providers in `main`

To provide `keyValueDbProvider` we use a `StateProvider`. Typically, a plain `Provider` would do if we just want to access one predefined concrete implementation. In this case we want to define a listener that listens to changes in the `keyValueDbProvider`, so we can do some async init and data loading work when we change to another implementation from UI inside the Flutter app.

```dart
/// Provides a [KeyValueDb] DB repository.
///
/// The value returned depends on the controller [usedKeyValueDbProvider].
final StateProvider<KeyValueDb> keyValueDbProvider =
StateProvider<KeyValueDb>((StateProviderRef<KeyValueDb> ref) {
  ref.onDispose(
        () {
      if (_debug) debugPrint('keyValueDbProvider: onDispose called');
    },
  );
  return ref.watch(usedKeyValueDbProvider).get;
}, name: 'keyValueDbProvider');
```

> I like to give Riverpod providers names using their `name` property, they are useful for debug purposes. For example in the `AppProviderObserver` we can use it to print the name of the provider that was changed.

The `keyValueDbListenerProvider` above in `main` is just a normal `provider`, that we use to access `KeyValueDbListener`.

```dart
/// A provider used to read and activate a [KeyValueDbListener].
final Provider<KeyValueDbListener> keyValueDbListenerProvider =
Provider<KeyValueDbListener>((ProviderRef<KeyValueDbListener> ref) {
  if (_debug) debugPrint('keyValueDbListenerProvider called');
  return KeyValueDbListener(ref);
});
```

### Listener `KeyValueDbListener` Callback When DB is Changed

The act of reading the `container.read(keyValueDbListenerProvider)`, will instantiate the `KeyValueDbListener`. In it, we will define a listener that allows us to listen for changes to the `keyValueDbProvider` and run a call-back that does the async work of initializing the new `KeyValueDb` we switched to.

```dart
/// A listener that listens to changes in the [keyValueDbProvider].
///
/// When the [keyValueDbProvider] state changes, we initialize the
/// new provided DB and read all its DB values and updates UI settings
/// controls to the values from the new [KeyValueDb] implementation.
class KeyValueDbListener {
  // Pass a Ref argument to the constructor
  KeyValueDbListener(this.ref) {
    if (_debug) debugPrint('KeyValueDbListener: new instance');
    // Call _init as soon as the object is created
    _init();
  }
  final Ref ref;

  void _init() {
    if (_debug) debugPrint('KeyValueDbListener: _init() setup listen');
    // Listen to state changes in keyValueDbProvider.state.
    ref.listen<StateController<KeyValueDb>>(keyValueDbProvider.state,
            (StateController<KeyValueDb>? previous,
            StateController<KeyValueDb> current) async {
          final KeyValueDb keyValueDb = current.state;
          // This callback executes when the keyValueDbProvider value changes.
          if (_debug) {
            debugPrint('KeyValueDbListener: listen called - - - - -');
            debugPrint('  DB switch : ${current.state}');
          }
          await keyValueDb.init();
          // We changed key valued DB, we must update all settings controls.
          Settings.getAll(ref);
        });
  }
}
``` 

This approach is very similar to the one described by [Andrea Bizzotto](https://github.com/bizz84/) in his article ["Flutter Riverpod: How to Register a Listener during App Startup"](https://codewithandrea.com/articles/riverpod-initialize-listener-app-startup/). In this solution we do not need streams, since we are only listening to a change in a UI control used to select the used key-value DB implementation.

### State Controller `usedKeyValueDbProvider` Used by UI to Change DB

The last part is that above in the `keyValueDbProvider` we watch `usedKeyValueDbProvider` and used the getter `get` in `ref.watch(usedKeyValueDbProvider).get` to get the user selected key-value DB implementation. 

The `usedKeyValueDbProvider` is a simple `StateProvider` that holds an `enum` value called `UsedKeyValueDb`. We can use this `usedKeyValueDbProvider` and change its state value with for example a `ToggleButtons` UI widget. 

```dart
/// A [StateProvider] controller used to control which [KeyValueDb]
/// implementation is used.
///
/// Used by UI widgets to select used [KeyValueDb] implementation.
final StateProvider<UsedKeyValueDb> usedKeyValueDbProvider =
StateProvider<UsedKeyValueDb>(
      (final StateProviderRef<UsedKeyValueDb> ref) => AppDb.keyValue,
  name: 'usedKeyValueDbProvider',
);
```

### Enhanced `enum` `UsedKeyValueDb`

The `UsedKeyValueDb` is also an [enhanced enum](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour#declaring-enhanced-enums) and its getter, `get` can be used to return the corresponding key-value DB implementation.

```dart
/// An enhanced enum used to represent, select and describe the used 
/// [KeyValueDb] implementation.
enum UsedKeyValueDb {
  memory(),
  sharedPreferences(),
  hive(AppDb.keyValueFilename); // Used filename for the Hive storage box.

  final String _filename;
  const UsedKeyValueDb([this._filename = '']);

  /// Get the [KeyValueDb] implementation corresponding to the enum value.
  KeyValueDb get get {
    switch (this) {
      case UsedKeyValueDb.memory:
        return KeyValueDbMem();
      case UsedKeyValueDb.sharedPreferences:
        return KeyValueDbPrefs();
      case UsedKeyValueDb.hive:
        return KeyValueDbHive(_filename);
    }
  }

  /// Describe the [KeyValueDb] implementation corresponding to the enum value.
  String get describe {
    switch (this) {
      case UsedKeyValueDb.memory:
        return 'Memory';
      case UsedKeyValueDb.sharedPreferences:
        return 'Shared Preferences';
      case UsedKeyValueDb.hive:
        return 'Hive';
    }
  }
}
```

You could write the above with just functions or extensions based on a regular old Dart enum as well, but the above nicely encapsulates it all, and the enum provides needed functions directly. 

### UI to Change Used Key-Value DB

Lastly we need a bit of UI to actually change the used key-value DB implementation on the fly. We have three different options, so for this use case I like to use a simple `ToggleButtons` implementation that changes state provider `usedKeyValueDbProvider`.  

```dart
/// UI to toggle the used [KeyValueDb] implementation of the application.
///
/// This [ToggleButtons] UI control bakes in a Riverpod [StateProvider] and is
/// tied to this app implementation. This approach is however very easy to use
/// since there is nothing to pass around to use the UI widget. 
/// Just drop in the const Widget anywhere in the app and use the UI control.
@immutable
class KeyValueDbToggleButtons extends ConsumerWidget {
  const KeyValueDbToggleButtons({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    final UsedKeyValueDb keyValueDb = ref.watch(usedKeyValueDbProvider);
    final List<bool> isSelected = <bool>[
      keyValueDb == UsedKeyValueDb.memory,
      keyValueDb == UsedKeyValueDb.sharedPreferences,
      keyValueDb == UsedKeyValueDb.hive,
    ];
    return ToggleButtons(
      isSelected: isSelected,
      onPressed: (int newIndex) {
        ref.read(usedKeyValueDbProvider.notifier).state =
            UsedKeyValueDb.values[newIndex];
      },
      children: const <Widget>[
        Padding(
          padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 8.0),
          child: Text('Mem'),
        ),
        Padding(
          padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 8.0),
          child: Text('Prefs'),
        ),
        Padding(
          padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 8.0),
          child: Text('Hive'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

This `ToggleButtons` is small enough to even be dropped into the `trailing` property of a `ListTile` widget, so let's try that. And for even more convenience, we make the `ListTile` tapping be used as a way to cycle through the toggle button option. This is very handy, we can still also select the options directly by tapping the option in the `ToggleButtons`.

```dart
class KeyValueDbListTile extends ConsumerWidget {
  const KeyValueDbListTile({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    final String usedDb = ref.watch(usedKeyValueDbProvider).describe;
    return ListTile(
      title: const Text('Storage'),
      subtitle: Text(usedDb),
      trailing: const KeyValueDbToggleButtons(),
      onTap: () {
        switch (ref.read(usedKeyValueDbProvider.notifier).state) {
          case UsedKeyValueDb.memory:
            ref.read(usedKeyValueDbProvider.notifier).state =
                UsedKeyValueDb.sharedPreferences;
            break;
          case UsedKeyValueDb.sharedPreferences:
            ref.read(usedKeyValueDbProvider.notifier).state =
                UsedKeyValueDb.hive;
            break;
          case UsedKeyValueDb.hive:
            ref.read(usedKeyValueDbProvider.notifier).state =
                UsedKeyValueDb.memory;
            break;
        }
      },
    );
  }
}
```

This is what it looks like in action:

*Using UI to change the used key-value DB implementation*

The themes and buttons looks all different when the key-value DB implementation is switched. That is because different theme settings defined with **FlexColorScheme** had been configured using the different key-value DB implementations. When we switch implementation, the settings persisted in that implementation is loaded and the theme changes to it.


That's it for being able to switch in different key-value DB implementation using only **Riverpod**. Perhaps there is a better way, but this worked and that was the aim of this part of the demo. How useful it is depends on what you use it for.

## Persistence Design

One of the goals with the design of the used key-value persistence model and Riverpod providers using it, was that each settings value should be saved with its own `key` string. When you change a setting, only the value for this key is persisted, and only the widget that toggles this value is rebuilt. This was desired mostly for storage efficiency and for speed when modifying theme settings interactively. When settings widget toggle theme properties, it typically results in a new `ThemeData` object, which requires rebuilding the app UI anyway with the new effective `ThemeData`. 

We could also serialize a big settings class with all the properties to a JSON and save the entire JSON with just one key. We would then be writing the entire "large" JSON file to the key-value DB every time a single settings value is changed. This was not desired.

We also did not want to use a freezed or handwritten immutable class with all the settings properties in it. Because then we would have to use a `select` filter for every property in every widget using a settings entry, to ensure only it is rebuilt when its value is changed. We would also need to `select` filter that we only want to store the property value that was changed into the used key-value DB.

We could use just simple `StateProviders` for the settings entries, I have used this approach. While it works, if we use `StateNotifier` and `StateNotifierProvider`, we have more control and can make an interfaces for it that provides functions that reads very nicely.

When the app starts, it sets the state for each settings entry value by checking if its key exists in the key-value DB. If it exists, then this previously persisted value is used as start value. If the key did not exist, then a hard coded const default value for the settings value in question is used.  


## Key-Value Database

For the key-value database to persist the settings we use an abstraction layer, and as an example offer a few implementation examples using two popular Flutter packages.

0. KeyValueDb - Abstract interface.
1. KeyValueDbMem - Volatile memory implementation, just a map.
2. KeyValueDbPrefs - [SharedPreferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences) implementation.
3. KeyValueDbHive - [Hive](https://pub.dev/packages/hive) implementation.

It would be very straight forward to add additional key-value based settings implementations. Maybe even add one that uses the local implementation as off-line cache and also persist settings in cloud based implementation, so users can bring their preferences with them when they switch to another device or platform. 

Typically, you would of course only have one implementation and use this repository abstraction to limit the places where you interface with the actual storage solution. It of course also enables swapping it out easily, should it ever be needed. In practice, it is seldom needed in the life-span of most applications, but hey we like over-engineered solutions.

### Abstract Key-Value DB Interface

The needed interface for the key-value database in this demo is very simple. It is the same as the one used in the FlexColorScheme [example applications](https://docs.flexcolorscheme.com/tutorial3#themeserviceprefs). In its entirety it looks like this:

```dart
/// Abstract interface for the [KeyValueDb] used to get and put (save) simple
/// key-value pairs.
abstract class KeyValueDb {
  /// A [KeyValueDb] implementation may override this method to perform
  /// all its needed initialization and setup work.
  Future<void> init();

  /// A [KeyValueDb] implementation may override this method to perform
  /// needed cleanup on close and dispose.
  Future<void> dispose();

  /// Get a `value` from the [KeyValueDb], using string `key` as its key.
  ///
  /// If `key` does not exist in the repository, return `defaultValue`.
  T get<T>(String key, T defaultValue);

  /// Put "save" a `value` in the [KeyValueDb] service, using `key` as its
  /// storage key.
  Future<void> put<T>(String key, T value);
}
``` 

### Memory Key-Value DB Implementation

To make a simple naive memory and session based key-value DB we can use a `Map`. In this case we also wanted the key-value pairs to be kept when we switch between implementations, even if the `keyValueDbProvider` makes a new instance. We could have made `KeyValueDbMem` itself a singleton, but all we actually needed was for it to have a private static map.

```dart
// Set the bool flag to true to show debug prints. Even if you forgot
// to set it to false, debug prints will not show in release builds.
// The handy part is that if it gets in the way in debugging, it is an easy
// toggle to turn it off here for just this feature. You can leave it true
// below to see this feature's logs in debug mode.
const bool _debug = !kReleaseMode && true;

/// A repository that stores and retrieves key-value settings pairs from
/// volatile ram memory.
///
/// This class keeps the key-value pairs in a private static final Map during
/// app execution, so we can get the same Map data also when we get a
/// new instance of the mem key-value db, this happens when we dynamically in
/// the app switch to another implementation and back to mem again.
class KeyValueDbMem implements KeyValueDb {
  // A private static Map that stores the key-value pairs.
  //
  // This is kept in memory as long as app runs, not so pretty, but simple.
  // We could make the entire class a singleton too, but we don't need to, this
  // works well enough for this demo.
  static final Map<String, dynamic> _memKeyValueDb = <String, dynamic>{};

  /// [KeyValueDbMem] implementation needs no init functionality.
  @override
  Future<void> init() async {
    if (_debug) debugPrint('KeyValueDbMem: init called');
  }

  /// [KeyValueDbMem] implementation needs no dispose functionality.
  @override
  Future<void> dispose() async {
    if (_debug) debugPrint('KeyValueDbMem: dispose called');
  }

  /// Get a settings value from the mem db, using [key] to access it.
  ///
  /// If key does not exist, return the [defaultValue].
  @override
  T get<T>(String key, T defaultValue) {
    try {
      if (_memKeyValueDb.containsKey(key)) {
        final T value = _memKeyValueDb[key] as T;
        if (_debug) {
          debugPrint('MemDB get   : ["$key"] = $value (${value.runtimeType})');
        }
        if (value == null) {
          return null as T;
        } else {
          return value;
        }
      } else {
        return defaultValue;
      }
    } catch (e) {
      debugPrint('MemDB get (load) ERROR');
      debugPrint(' Error message ...... : $e');
      debugPrint(' Store key .......... : $key');
      debugPrint(' defaultValue ....... : $defaultValue');
    }
    // If something went wrong we return the default value.
    return defaultValue;
  }

  /// Put a settings [value] to the mem db, using [key], as key for the value.
  @override
  Future<void> put<T>(String key, T value) async {
    if (_debug) {
      debugPrint('MemDB put   : ["$key"] = $value (${value.runtimeType})');
    }
    _memKeyValueDb[key] = value;
  }
}
```

To make it easy to track what is happening in the app, this class and many others, as well as the providers include `debugPrints` that shows what is happening on the console. The debug prints are behind a `_debug` flag that can be toggled on/off individually for each file. The flag is always automatically toggled off in a release build.

### SharedPreferences and Hive Key-Value DB Implementations

The used SharedPreferences and Hive key-value database implementations are the same as the ones used in the FlexColorScheme [example applications](https://docs.flexcolorscheme.com/tutorial3#themeserviceprefs). They also have the same requirement that we need to be able to store a `null` settings entry value. Using `null` values in Flutter SDK themes have the meaning that we want the widget's default un-themed behavior. 

We cannot use the absence of a key in the key-value database to represent `null`. No key found, gives us our coded const default value for a theme setting, it is usually not `null`, but it might be, and even if it is not, we might in some cases want to be able to select a default `null` choice, to get the SDK default `null` un-themed behavior. In this demo, the `AppBar` style is one example of that.

To be able to do this, we need to be able to persist nullable values in the key-value DB. The used map for our volatile memory storage allows us to do that, as does Hive. However, SharedPreferences does support storing `null` at all. So its implementation includes a work-around to use some other suitable value to represent the persisted `null` choice, and return null back when that value is found. 

Both the Hive and the Shared Preferences also include converters to persist different `enum`'s in a type safe way, and `Color` as `ìnt` values. Hive provides its own `TypeAdapter` class that allows us to do the same. For the SharedPreferences implementation we baked in the type conversions.

Obviously to add handling of additional data types we need to add handling of them to our Hive and SharedPreferences implementations.

We won't go through the implementations here, but you can find the [Hive one here]() the SharedPreferences one here[here](), if you want to study them. The one for SharedPreferences is quite a bit longer, in order to handle both the occasionally needed nullable types, and the type conversions. 
 
## Settings

The settings approach setup used in this demo might be considered a bit controversial. I like it for the simplicity it results in when persisting the individual key-value pairs. Since it also gives each settings entry value its own provider, it is very simple to use in UI widgets. 

I might demonstrate another implementation later, but this works well, is convenient to use and does not seem to be heavy to use, despite using a quite a few `StateNotifierProviders`.

The used `Settings` class is actually only static container class. We could just as wel have it all as top level const and final values. However, wrapping them in `Settings` class, name spaces them and encapsulates them nicely. Basically this is like using classes to wrap app config constant values. Purist Dart guide says don't this. I say do, also in my [lint rules](https://rydmike.com/blog_flutter_linting). Do it for the name spacing and nice code completion it gives you. This demo app also uses this for a number application constants in several `AppNnnn` const classes.

In the `Settings` statics only class we basically have the following:

- Private static constants for the settings entry default values.
- Private static constant string keys for all the settings entry keys.
- A static function to `reset` all settings to their default values.
- A static function to `init` all settings entry values to the values they have in the DB.
- A static final `StateNotifierProvider` of type `SettingsEntry` for every settings value. 


```Dart
/// A static container class for all our settings providers, default values and
/// used key-value DB keys.
class Settings {
  // This constructor prevents external instantiation and extension.
  Settings._();

  // Use material 3, theme mode and active color scheme.
  static const bool _useMaterial3 = false;
  static const ThemeMode _themeMode = ThemeMode.system;
  static const int _schemeIndex = 0;
  // 8< - - - snip repetitive const code removed.

  /// Reset all settings entries and their controllers to their default values.
  ///
  /// This action is triggered by the user when they want to reset all settings
  /// values to their app default values.
  static void reset(WidgetRef ref) {
    if (_debug) debugPrint('Settings: resetAll DB values');
    // Use material 3, theme mode and active color scheme.
    ref.read(useMaterial3Provider.notifier).reset();
    ref.read(themeModeProvider.notifier).reset();
    ref.read(schemeIndexProvider.notifier).reset();
    // 8< - - - snip repetitive reset code removed.
  }

  /// String key used for defining if we use Material 3 or Material 2.
  static const String _keyUseMaterial3 = 'useMaterial3';
  /// Provider for swapping primary and secondary colors in light theme mode.
  static final StateNotifierProvider<SettingsEntry<bool>, bool>
  useMaterial3Provider = StateNotifierProvider<SettingsEntry<bool>, bool>(
            (StateNotifierProviderRef<SettingsEntry<bool>, bool> ref) {
      return SettingsEntry<bool>(
        ref,
        defaultValue: _useMaterial3,
        key: _keyUseMaterial3,
      );
    },
    // Use the unique key-value DB key as provider name, useful for debugging.
    name: '${_keyUseMaterial3}Provider',
  );

  /// String key used for storing the last used app theme mode.
  static const String _keyThemeMode = 'themeMode';
  /// The themeModeProvider represents a [StateProvider] to provide the state of
  /// the [ThemeMode], so to be able to toggle the application wide theme mode.
  static final StateNotifierProvider<SettingsEntry<ThemeMode>, ThemeMode>
  themeModeProvider =
  StateNotifierProvider<SettingsEntry<ThemeMode>, ThemeMode>(
            (StateNotifierProviderRef<SettingsEntry<ThemeMode>, ThemeMode> ref) {
      return SettingsEntry<ThemeMode>(
        ref,
        defaultValue: _themeMode,
        key: _keyThemeMode,
      );
    },
    name: '${_keyThemeMode}Provider',
  );

  /// String key for storing theme settings index.
  static const String _keySchemeIndex = 'schemeIndex';
  /// The index provider of the currently used color scheme and theme.
  static final StateNotifierProvider<SettingsEntry<int>, int>
  schemeIndexProvider = StateNotifierProvider<SettingsEntry<int>, int>(
            (StateNotifierProviderRef<SettingsEntry<int>, int> ref) {
      return SettingsEntry<int>(
        ref,
        defaultValue: _schemeIndex,
        key: _keySchemeIndex,
      );
    },
    // Use the unique key-value DB key as provider name, useful for debugging.
    name: '${_keySchemeIndex}Provider',
  );

  // 8< - - - snip repetitive code for similar settings entry providers removed.  
}
```

All the above is basically just static definitions, sure there is quite a bit of it, but it is 
pretty straight forward. The `SettingsEntry` based `StateNotifierProvider` providers might look a bit complex, maybe it is because this code base uses lint rules that requires you to explicitly always specify all types. 

Let's examine the `SettingsEntry` class to better understand what is happening.

### Settings Entry

The `SettingsEntry` class is a quite small extension of the `StateNotifier` class. It is also a generic, so we can use it with arbitrary data types. The generic classes w can use, does however have the limitation that it also has to be supported by our used `KeyValueDb` implementation. 

It gets a Riverpod `Ref` object, that we use to find the currently used `KeyValueDb` implementation via the `keyValueDbProvider`.

It also requires a default value of type same generic type `<T>` that we will tell the DB to return if there is now value stored for the String `key` that is also required.

When we read `StateNotifierProvider` of type `SettingsEntry` it will be instantiated and get the appropriate default value, either from the key-value DB if it had a value stored for the `key` or via the provided `defaultValue`.

We also define a `set()` function that will update both the state of the provider and the key-value DB entry to the new value.

```dart
/// A persisted app settings entry class.
///
/// Can be of any value type that the used key-value DB implementation supports.
class SettingsEntry<T> extends StateNotifier<T> {
  final Ref ref;
  final T defaultValue;
  final String key;

  SettingsEntry(
    this.ref, {
    required this.key,
    required this.defaultValue,
  }) : super(defaultValue) {
    // Initialize the notifier's state value.
    init();
  }

  /// Init the settings entry from the used key-value DB implementation.
  void init() {
    // Get the used-key value DB implementation.
    final KeyValueDb db = ref.read(keyValueDbProvider);
    // Read the value for the provided key from the used key-value DB.
    // The db value get returns the default value if key does not exist in it.
    final T newValue = db.get(key, defaultValue);
    // Only set state to db value, if it is different from current value.
    // StateNotifier does not emit a new state either if value is identical,
    // but we check too so we can exit earlier and to be very explicit about it.
    if (state != newValue) state = newValue;
  }

  /// Update the settings state with a new value.
  ///
  /// If the new value is different from current state value:
  /// - Assign new value to current state.
  /// - Persist the value to the used-key value DB implementation.
  void set(T newValue) {
    if (state == newValue) return;
    state = newValue;
    final KeyValueDb db = ref.read(keyValueDbProvider);
    unawaited(db.put(key, newValue));
  }

  /// Rest a settings entry state to its default value.
  ///
  /// If it already is at its default value, do no work, return.
  /// - Set state to default value.
  /// - Update the key-value DB value entry for this key to its default value.
  void reset() {
    if (state == defaultValue) return;
    state = defaultValue;
    final KeyValueDb db = ref.read(keyValueDbProvider);
    unawaited(db.put(key, defaultValue));
  }
}
```

## Application UI

We won't be going through the entire application's user interface code. It is not so exiting, but let's look at a few examples of making and using UI widgets that use the providers in `Settings` class.

### Use Material 3 Switch

Let's start with a simple example. There is a theme settings switch in the UI that allows us to toggle if we use Material 3, or Material 2 based Flutter theming. The switch UI is based on `SwitchListTile` and setting its value and changing it, becomes this simple:

```dart
class UseMaterial3Switch extends ConsumerWidget {
  const UseMaterial3Switch({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    return SwitchListTileAdaptive(
      title: const Text('Use Material 3'),
      value: ref.watch(Settings.useMaterial3Provider),
      onChanged: ref.read(Settings.useMaterial3Provider.notifier).set,
    );
  }
}
```

It is easy to see with a little of Riverpod insights that the switch `value` will change as soon as the `ref.watch(Settings.useMaterial3Provider)` changes its state value. 

You may first think that the `onChnaged` callback function `ref.read(Settings.useMaterial3Provider.notifier).set` looks unfamiliar. It is however only a tear-off using the `set` method of the provider, which in this case will also be a function that takes a `bool` value, matching the signature of the switch `onChnaged` callback. 

The `notifer` on the `ref.Read` on the `Settings.useMaterial3Provider` returns the underlying notifier, in this case `StateNotifier<Bool>`, we can then use its methods, in this case `set(bool newValue)`.     

For the UI we end with a simple `const` constructor widget, that needs no properties, we can drop it in as a widget wherever we want to control this setting in the application's UI. We can use it in **any** screen, dialog, drawer, bottom sheet, etc. When the switch is toggled, the updated settings value will be persisted and the application theme will change to reflect the new theme result. 

Could not be simpler to use, but admittedly to get to this simplicity takes a bit of abstractions, setup and Riverpod definitions.

>You might have noticed that the UI widget above uses a `SwitchListTileAdaptive` widget. This is a very simple wrapper for `SwitchListTile.adaptive`. Why is it needed? To find out why, check out its code and comments here: **TODO:** Add url to code.

### Active Theme Mode `ToggleButtons`

Let's look at another example. Toggling the theme mode from light, to dark and also optionally choosing the system mode. The property defining this in the `MaterialApp` is a `ThemeMode` `**enum**` value. Since we made our key-value DB support this type, and we made a `Settings.themeModeProvider` using a `SettingsEntry` of type `<ThemeMode>` for it, we can make a simple `ToggleButtons` 3-state switch for it.

```dart
class ThemeModeToggleButtons extends ConsumerWidget {
  const ThemeModeToggleButtons({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    final ThemeMode themeMode = ref.watch(Settings.themeModeProvider);
    final List<bool> isSelected = <bool>[
      themeMode == ThemeMode.light,
      themeMode == ThemeMode.system,
      themeMode == ThemeMode.dark,
    ];
    return ToggleButtons(
      isSelected: isSelected,
      onPressed: (int newIndex) {
        if (newIndex == 0) {
          ref.read(Settings.themeModeProvider.notifier).set(ThemeMode.light);
        } else if (newIndex == 1) {
          ref.read(Settings.themeModeProvider.notifier).set(ThemeMode.system);
        } else {
          ref.read(Settings.themeModeProvider.notifier).set(ThemeMode.dark);
        }
      },
      children: const <Widget>[
        Icon(AppIcons.lightTheme),
        Icon(AppIcons.systemTheme),
        Icon(AppIcons.darkTheme),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

The `ToggleButtons` has a quite simple but flexible model for toggling its buttons state. We just need a bit of logic for it. In this case we also wanted the buttons to have the order, `light`, `system`, `dark`. If we had been happy with the `ThemeMode` mode `*enum*` values order `system`, `light`, `dark` we could have made it bit simpler.

This `ToggleButtons` already work as is, it is also small enough to use it as a `trailing` widget in a `ListTile`. When I use `ListTile` I like it its `onTap` callback to do something useful, in this case we can make it to lazy users options for hitting a big UI target and cycling through the `ThemeMode`s. Here is a handy `ListTile` widget for this. We can set its title if we need a shorter version in tight places. The subtitle is the active theme mode `*enum*` name using sentence case. For the `onTap` callback we cycle through the modes in desired order. As trailing widget we just give the above `ThemeModeToggleButtons`, we don't have to do anything else, its button state will also automatically update when we change mode of same `Settings.themeModeProvider`.


```dart
class ThemeModeListTile extends ConsumerWidget {
  const ThemeModeListTile({this.title, super.key});
  final Widget? title;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    final ThemeMode mode = ref.watch(Settings.themeModeProvider);
    return ListTile(
      title: title,
      subtitle: Text(mode.name.sentenceCase()),
      onTap: () {
        switch (ref.read(Settings.themeModeProvider)) {
          case ThemeMode.light:
            ref.read(Settings.themeModeProvider.notifier).set(ThemeMode.system);
            break;
          case ThemeMode.system:
            ref.read(Settings.themeModeProvider.notifier).set(ThemeMode.dark);
            break;
          case ThemeMode.dark:
            ref.read(Settings.themeModeProvider.notifier).set(ThemeMode.light);
            break;
        }
      },
      trailing: const ThemeModeToggleButtons(),
    );
  }
}
```

### Reactive UI Widgets

From the above example we can already see that we can easily make reactive UI widget. Using these Riverpod provider driven UI widgets, makes our UI widgets react to changes in their values regardless of where and when we change their data. Additionally using the UI control widgets anywhere in the app's widget tree, is as simple as dropping in the UI widget. To see this in action, take a look at this screen recording of this theme demo. 

**TODO:** Add GIF recording

In this example we see two UI widgets used, one for setting using Material 3 theming, and another one for opting in and out of using FlexColorScheme opinionated widget component themes. 

These widgets are first toggled on the home screen, then from the app `Drawer` and a from a `BottomSheet`. As we toggle them from these other UI locations, the application theme of course changes accordingly, but we also see the same widgets visible in the background home screen update the controls as well to the new value set in the `Drawer` and the `BottomSheet`. This happened without having to think about adding any extra update handling into our UI widgets, we already handle it, with the Riverpod providers we used.

## Theme Providers

Lastly lets look at how the application theme and `ThemeData` is made. This demo does not have all the dynamic theming features the the FlexColorScheme [Themes Playground](https://docs.flexcolorscheme.com/playground) does, but it packs a pretty good set too, and we can easily add more.

We already so in the `MaterialApp` that we used two providers `lightThemeProvider` and `darkThemeProvider` to provide the `ThemeData` to the `MaterialApp`'s light `theme` and dark `darkTheme` properties. These providers are vanilla providers, that use a static function, where the passed parameters are watchers of our `Settings` providers. The one for the light theme looks like this:

```dart
final Provider<ThemeData> lightThemeProvider = Provider<ThemeData>(
      (ProviderRef<ThemeData> ref) {
    // Make an always valid FlexTones config getter from our unsafe int.
    final bool useSeed = ref.watch(Settings.usePrimaryKeyColorProvider);
    final int flexTone = ref.watch(Settings.usedFlexToneProvider);
    final int usedFlexTone =
    flexTone < 0 || flexTone >= FlexTone.values.length || !useSeed
        ? 0
        : flexTone;
    return AppTheme.light(
      useMaterial3: ref.watch(Settings.useMaterial3Provider),
      usedTheme: ref.watch(Settings.schemeIndexProvider),
      swapColors: ref.watch(Settings.lightSwapColorsProvider),
      surfaceMode: ref.watch(Settings.lightSurfaceModeProvider),
      blendLevel: ref.watch(Settings.lightBlendLevelProvider),
      usePrimaryKeyColor: useSeed,
      useSecondaryKeyColor: ref.watch(Settings.useSecondaryKeyColorProvider),
      useTertiaryKeyColor: ref.watch(Settings.useTertiaryKeyColorProvider),
      usedFlexTone: usedFlexTone,
      appBarElevation: ref.watch(Settings.appBarElevationProvider),
      appBarStyle: ref.watch(Settings.lightAppBarStyleProvider),
      appBarOpacity: ref.watch(Settings.lightAppBarOpacityProvider),
      transparentStatusBar: ref.watch(Settings.transparentStatusBarProvider),
      useSubTheme: ref.watch(Settings.useSubThemesProvider),
      defaultRadius: ref.watch(Settings.defaultRadiusProvider),
      platform: ref.watch(platformProvider),
    );
  },
  name: 'lightThemeProvider',
);
```

The one for the dark theme is equivalent.

### Application Theme

The `AppTheme` is again a very simple class with only static functions and constants. The main functions are the `AppTheme.light` and `AppTheme.dark` ones. The rest is just constants to define some example custom theme colors and to build a const list that contains all available color themes we can switch between.

The `AppTheme.light` and `AppTheme.dark` functions are pretty equivalent, the dark theme as a few more parameters. Some used parameters share the `Settings` provider, but in many cases we have separate `Settings` providers for the dark theme, so light and dark theme parameters can be controlled and configured separately.


```dart
/// The themes for this app are defined here.
class AppTheme {
  AppTheme._();

  /// Returns light theme based on customizable required properties passed to it.
  static ThemeData light({
    required bool useMaterial3,
    required int usedTheme,
    required bool swapColors,
    required FlexSurfaceMode surfaceMode,
    required int blendLevel,
    required bool usePrimaryKeyColor,
    required bool useSecondaryKeyColor,
    required bool useTertiaryKeyColor,
    required int usedFlexTone,
    required double appBarElevation,
    required FlexAppBarStyle? appBarStyle,
    required double appBarOpacity,
    required bool transparentStatusBar,
    required bool useSubTheme,
    required double? defaultRadius,
    required TargetPlatform platform,
  }) {
    return FlexThemeData.light(
      useMaterial3: useMaterial3,
      colors: schemes[usedTheme].light,
      swapColors: swapColors,
      surfaceMode: surfaceMode,
      blendLevel: blendLevel,
      keyColors: FlexKeyColors(
        useKeyColors: usePrimaryKeyColor,
        useSecondary: useSecondaryKeyColor,
        useTertiary: useTertiaryKeyColor,
      ),
      tones: FlexTone.values[usedFlexTone].tones(Brightness.light),
      appBarElevation: appBarElevation,
      appBarStyle: appBarStyle,
      appBarOpacity: appBarOpacity,
      transparentStatusBar: transparentStatusBar,
      subThemesData: useSubTheme
        ? FlexSubThemesData(
            defaultRadius: defaultRadius,
            thinBorderWidth: 1,
            thickBorderWidth: 2)
        : null,
      visualDensity: FlexColorScheme.comfortablePlatformDensity,
      fontFamily: AppFonts.mainFont,
      typography: Typography.material2021(platform: platform),
      platform: platform,
    );
  }
  
  // 8< snip - - - dark them and a bunch of const values removed.
  //
  // Plus above we used `FlexThemeData.light`, but for educational purposes
  // FlexColorScheme.light() and its `toTheme` methods is used in the actual code.
}
```

To learn more about what `FlexColorScheme` does when the properties above, and understanding what is invloved in all its theming magic, I recommend reading the [FlexColorScheme docs](https://docs.flexcolorscheme.com/) from start to finnish, and to check out its very complete [API documentation](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/flex_color_scheme-library.html).

That's pretty much all there is to it. If there is anything in this educational demo app you would like further explanations about. Drop a note in its repo discussions section and ask a question. I might extend this readme to clarify it, or answer directly in the discussions.
