# Changelog

All notable changes to the **ThemeDemo** application are documented here.


## 0.9.2

**Oct 27-28, 2022**

This version bump is an internal change to using `Notifier` instead of `StateNotifier` when possible. It also moves the counter `StateProvider` to `NotifierProvider` to make its code more expressive. Application functionality remains unchanged. This change uses the new Riverpod 2 `Notifier` and `NotifierProvider`.

* Counter demo got a `Counter` model class that extends `Notifier` and it got an `incement` method. Its provider was changed StateProvider, to a `NotifierProvider`.
* Changed `SettingsEntry` from extending `StateNotifier` to simpler `Notifier` class.
* Changed all `Settings` providers from `StateNotifierProvider` to `NotifierProvider`.
