// TODO(rydmike): Copy this version to FlexColorScheme.

/// A theme following wrapper for [SwitchListTileAdaptive].
///
/// This wrapper sets the active thumb color for the switch in iOS or macOS
/// adaptive mode to a color that matches themed value on the switch in
/// Material on other platforms.
///
/// In iOS and MacOS adaptive mode, the switch color is always iOS switch green,
/// we want to follow the Material theme colors. If a switch color is not
/// defined and we are on iOS or macOS, and using Material 2
/// (theme.useMaterial3 = false) the switch will be theme.colorscheme.secondary
/// and if using Material3 (theme.useMaterial3 = true) to
/// theme.colorscheme.primary.
///
/// NOTE: toggleableActiveColor will be deprecated soon in Flutter SDK,
/// so we are using its replacement fallback already now. See:
/// https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/toggleable-active-color
///
/// The theme sets this color too, and that is fine for the Material mode.
/// However, if we want the color to also have an effect on the switch
/// when it is in its Cupertino mode, we actually have to set the [activeColor]
/// the the same color for the switch thumb. The Cupertino thumb switch button
/// cannot be changed via Material dependent theme. It cannot even be changed
/// with a Cupertino theme in a Cupertino app. It is so by design, since Apple
/// wants it to always be bright green when it is on.
///
/// In this app we want it to follow the selected theme color for consistency,
/// so we wrap the widget in a simple wrapper that sets the color to its
/// themed color, then it works and we get the themed color also in its
/// adaptive Cupertino mode.
///
/// This wrapper only wraps most common properties that we needed for the
/// SwitchListTileAdaptive in this application. Easy to add more when needed.
