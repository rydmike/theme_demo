/// This type of layout is often used on web pages.
///
/// It provides the following features to the content of the page:
/// - Adds a scrollbar
/// - Adds the capability to un-focus a control like a TextFiled by clicking on
///   the background.
/// - Center the content and limit the content width when a given max width
///   constraint is exceeded.
///
///  This implementation has a flaw, you cannot mouse or touch/drag scroll from
///  expanding margin areas like you could in a Web view. Read more about
///  it here: https://rydmike.com/blog_layout_and_theming

/// can be dropped into any application.
